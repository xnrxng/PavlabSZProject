abstract = {Single-cell genomics is a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous tissues such as the brain. Yet little is understood about how genetic variants influence cell-level gene expression. Addressing this, we uniformly processed single-nuclei, multiomics datasets into a resource comprising \&gt;2.8 million nuclei from the prefrontal cortex across 388 individuals. For 28 cell types, we assessed population-level variation in expression and chromatin across gene families and drug targets. We identified \&gt;550,000 cell type–specific regulatory elements and \&gt;1.4 million single-cell expression quantitative trait loci, which we used to build cell-type regulatory and cell-to-cell communication networks. These networks manifest cellular changes in aging and neuropsychiatric disorders. We further constructed an integrative model accurately imputing single-cell expression and simulating perturbations; the model prioritized ~250 disease-risk genes and drug targets with associated cell types.}}

abstract = {The granular dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is an evolutionary specialization of primates that is centrally involved in cognition. We assessed more than 600,000 single-nucleus transcriptomes from adult human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset dlPFC. Although most cell subtypes defined transcriptomically are conserved, we detected several that exist only in a subset of species as well as substantial species-specific molecular differences across homologous neuronal, glial, and non-neural subtypes. The latter are exemplified by human-specific switching between expression of the neuropeptide somatostatin and tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine production in certain interneurons. The above molecular differences are also illustrated by expression of the neuropsychiatric risk gene FOXP2, which is human-specific in microglia and primate-specific in layer 4 granular neurons. We generated a comprehensive survey of the dlPFC cellular repertoire and its shared and divergent features in anthropoid primates. Primate brains benefit from an evolutionary specialization of the cortex that supports cognition. Ma et al. tracked transcriptomes from cellular nuclei sampled from human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset brain cortices. The transcriptomes define groups of cell types, some of which are conserved and some that differ between these species. Several human-specific specializations were identified. Expression patterns of more than 900 genes associated with brain disorders revealed a variety of conserved, divergent, group-specific patterns. —PJH Single-cell transcriptomics reveals prefrontal cell taxonomy and species differences in human, chimpanzee, macaque, and marmoset.}}

abstract = {Autism manifests in many ways. Despite that diversity, the disorder seems to affect specific cellular pathways, including those observed in the neocortex of patients' brains. Velmeshev et al. analyzed the transcriptomes of single brain cells, including neurons and glia, from patients with autism. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis suggested that affected pathways regulate synapse function as well as neural outgrowth and migration. Furthermore, in patient samples, specific sets of genes enriched in upper-layer projection neurons and microglia correlated with clinical severity. Science, this issue p. 685 Single-cell analysis categorizes brain cell types most affected by autism and correlates transcriptional alterations with clinical symptoms. Despite the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of autism, bulk gene expression studies show that changes in the neocortex of autism patients converge on common genes and pathways. However, direct assessment of specific cell types in the brain affected by autism has not been feasible until recently. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing of cortical tissue from patients with autism to identify autism-associated transcriptomic changes in specific cell types. We found that synaptic signaling of upper-layer excitatory neurons and the molecular state of microglia are preferentially affected in autism. Moreover, our results show that dysregulation of specific groups of genes in cortico-cortical projection neurons correlates with clinical severity of autism. These findings suggest that molecular changes in upper-layer cortical circuits are linked to behavioral manifestations of autism.}}

abstract = {The complexity and heterogeneity of schizophrenia have hindered mechanistic elucidation and the development of more effective therapies. Here, we performed single-cell dissection of schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across 140 individuals in two independent cohorts. Excitatory neurons were the most affected cell group, with transcriptional changes converging on neurodevelopment and synapse-related molecular pathways. Transcriptional alterations included known genetic risk factors, suggesting convergence of rare and common genomic variants on neuronal population-specific alterations in schizophrenia. Based on the magnitude of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional change, we identified two populations of individuals with schizophrenia marked by expression of specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal cell states. This single-cell atlas links transcriptomic changes to etiological genetic risk factors, contextualizing established knowledge within the human cortical cytoarchitecture and facilitating mechanistic understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology and heterogeneity.}}

abstract = {Schizophrenia is one of the most widespread and complex mental disorders. To characterize the impact of schizophrenia, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of \&gt;220,000 neurons from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia and matched controls. In addition, \&gt;115,000 neurons were analyzed topographically by immunohistochemistry. Compositional analysis of snRNA-seq data revealed a reduction in abundance of GABAergic neurons and a concomitant increase in principal neurons, most pronounced for upper cortical layer subtypes, which was substantiated by histological analysis. Many neuronal subtypes showed extensive transcriptomic changes, the most marked in upper-layer GABAergic neurons, including down-regulation in energy metabolism and up-regulation in neurotransmission. Transcription factor network analysis demonstrated a developmental origin of transcriptomic changes. Last, Visium spatial transcriptomics further corroborated upper-layer neuron vulnerability in schizophrenia. Overall, our results point toward general network impairment within upper cortical layers as a core substrate associated with schizophrenia symptomatology. Single-cell and spatial analyses reveal upper cortical neurons are the most vulnerable in schizophrenia.}}

abstract = {Genomic profiling in postmortem brain from autistic individuals has consistently revealed convergent molecular changes. What drives these changes and how they relate to genetic susceptibility in this complex condition are not well understood. We performed deep single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to examine cell composition and transcriptomics, identifying dysregulation of cell type–specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which we corroborated using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics. Transcriptomic changes were primarily cell type specific, involving multiple cell types, most prominently interhemispheric and callosal-projecting neurons, interneurons within superficial laminae, and distinct glial reactive states involving oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. Autism-associated GRN drivers and their targets were enriched in rare and common genetic risk variants, connecting autism genetic susceptibility and cellular and circuit alterations in the human brain.}}

abstract = {Few neuropsychiatric disorders have replicable biomarkers, prompting high-resolution and large-scale molecular studies. However, we still lack consensus on a more foundational question: whether quantitative shifts in cell types—the functional unit of life—contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. Leveraging advances in human brain single-cell methylomics, we deconvolve seven major cell types using bulk DNA methylation profiling across 1270 postmortem brains, including from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and autism. We observe and replicate cell-type compositional shifts for Alzheimer’s disease (endothelial cell loss), autism (increased microglia), and schizophrenia (decreased oligodendrocytes), and find age- and sex-related changes. Multiple layers of evidence indicate that endothelial cell loss contributes to Alzheimer’s disease, with comparable effect size to APOE genotype among older people. Genome-wide association identified five genetic loci related to cell-type composition, involving plausible genes for the neurovascular unit (P2RX5 and TRPV3) and excitatory neurons (DPY30 and MEMO1). These results implicate specific cell-type shifts in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Analysis of cell-type composition from 1270 brains across three diagnoses implicates endothelial cell loss in Alzheimer’s disease.}}

abstract = {The molecular pathology of stress-related disorders remains elusive. Our brain multiregion, multiomic study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) included the central nucleus of the amygdala, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Genes and exons within the mPFC carried most disease signals replicated across two independent cohorts. Pathways pointed to immune function, neuronal and synaptic regulation, and stress hormones. Multiomic factor and gene network analyses provided the underlying genomic structure. Single nucleus RNA sequencing in dorsolateral PFC revealed dysregulated (stress-related) signals in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. Analyses of brain-blood intersections in \&gt;50,000 UK Biobank participants were conducted along with fine-mapping of the results of PTSD and MDD genome-wide association studies to distinguish risk from disease processes. Our data suggest shared and distinct molecular pathology in both disorders and propose potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.}}

abstract = {Sample-wise deconvolution methods estimate cell-type proportions and gene expressions in bulk tissue samples, yet their performance and biological applications remain unexplored, particularly in human brain transcriptomic data. Here, nine deconvolution methods were evaluated with sample-matched data from bulk tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell/nuclei (sc/sn) RNA-seq, and immunohistochemistry. A total of 1,130,767 nuclei per cells from 149 adult postmortem brains and 72 organoid samples were used. The results showed the best performance of dtangle for estimating cell proportions and bMIND for estimating sample-wise cell-type gene expressions. For eight brain cell types, 25,273 cell-type eQTLs were identified with deconvoluted expressions (decon-eQTLs). The results showed that decon-eQTLs explained more schizophrenia GWAS heritability than bulk tissue or single-cell eQTLs did alone. Differential gene expressions associated with Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and brain development were also examined using the deconvoluted data. Our findings, which were replicated in bulk tissue and single-cell data, provided insights into the biological applications of deconvoluted data in multiple brain disorders. Brain transcriptome deconvolution reveals cell-type proportions and expressions and uncovers eQTLs and disorder-related genes.}}

abstract = {The molecular organization of the human neocortex historically has been studied in the context of its histological layers. However, emerging spatial transcriptomic technologies have enabled unbiased identification of transcriptionally defined spatial domains that move beyond classic cytoarchitecture. We used the Visium spatial gene expression platform to generate a data-driven molecular neuroanatomical atlas across the anterior-posterior axis of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Integration with paired single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data revealed distinct cell type compositions and cell-cell interactions across spatial domains. Using PsychENCODE and publicly available data, we mapped the enrichment of cell types and genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders to discrete spatial domains.}}

abstract = {Few neuropsychiatric disorders have replicable biomarkers, prompting high-resolution and large-scale molecular studies. However, we still lack consensus on a more foundational question: whether quantitative shifts in cell types—the functional unit of life—contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. Leveraging advances in human brain single-cell methylomics, we deconvolve seven major cell types using bulk DNA methylation profiling across 1270 postmortem brains, including from individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and autism. We observe and replicate cell-type compositional shifts for Alzheimer’s disease (endothelial cell loss), autism (increased microglia), and schizophrenia (decreased oligodendrocytes), and find age- and sex-related changes. Multiple layers of evidence indicate that endothelial cell loss contributes to Alzheimer’s disease, with comparable effect size to APOE genotype among older people. Genome-wide association identified five genetic loci related to cell-type composition, involving plausible genes for the neurovascular unit (P2RX5 and TRPV3) and excitatory neurons (DPY30 and MEMO1). These results implicate specific cell-type shifts in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Analysis of cell-type composition from 1270 brains across three diagnoses implicates endothelial cell loss in Alzheimer’s disease.}}

abstract = {RNA splicing is highly prevalent in the brain and has strong links to neuropsychiatric disorders; yet, the role of cell type–specific splicing and transcript-isoform diversity during human brain development has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we leveraged single-molecule long-read sequencing to deeply profile the full-length transcriptome of the germinal zone and cortical plate regions of the developing human neocortex at tissue and single-cell resolution. We identified 214,516 distinct isoforms, of which 72.6\% were novel (not previously annotated in Gencode version 33), and uncovered a substantial contribution of transcript-isoform diversity—regulated by RNA binding proteins—in defining cellular identity in the developing neocortex. We leveraged this comprehensive isoform-centric gene annotation to reprioritize thousands of rare de novo risk variants and elucidate genetic risk mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders.}}
