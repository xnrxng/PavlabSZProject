### Preview of Data

The data used is from the @388Brains set of cohorts, with its samples. The raw data of the annotated expression matrices can be found [here](https://brainscope.gersteinlab.org/output-sample-annotated-matrix.html). All the samples come from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The metadata contains the information of the following 12 cohorts:

1. CMC
2. DevBrain
3. Girgenti-multiome
4. IsoHuB
5. LIBD
6. Ma_et_al [@MaSestan]
7. MultiomeBrain
8. PTSDBrainomics
9. SZBDMulti-Seq
10. ROSMAP
11. UCLA-ASD
12. Velmeshev_et_al [@Velmeshev]

However, because no annotated matrices were provided for the ROSMAP cohort, these were filtered out from the metadata.

This is an overview of each cohort:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-total-patients
#| tbl-cap: Each cohort with the total patients studied, the mean of the age of death, and disease studied.

total_patients <- read_csv("../results/1-total_patients.csv")
knitr::kable(total_patients)
```

From @tbl-total-patients, we can see that the CMC cohort has the biggest number of patient samples with 100 samples, followed by SZBDMulti-seq with 72. Ma_et_al has the smallest size, with only 2 samples. CMC and SZBDMulti-seq also have the highest mean of age of death at 71 years and 65 years respectively. Velmeshev_et_al has the lowest one, at 18 years. A variety of diseases are studied in these cohorts, with some cohorts studying none. These diseases include schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and Williams Syndrome.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-patientpercondition
#| tbl-cap: Number of patients per condition per cohort.

patientpercondition <- read_csv("../results/2-patients_per_condition.csv")
knitr::kable(patientpercondition)
```

@tbl-patientpercondition indicates the number of patients per condition in each cohort. The CMC cohort has the highest numbers, with 53 control samples and 47 schizophrenia samples. The UCLA-ASD is second, with 27 ASD samples and 25 control samples.

It must be noted that many patients' age at death was marked as "89+". In order to determine the age distribution and the mean age of death, these values were converted to "89". The number of samples that were marked as "89+" from the Schizophrenia cohorts is in @tbl-elderlypatients.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-elderlypatients
#| tbl-cap: Number of patients annotated as "89+" in Schizophrenia cohorts.

elderlypatients <- read_csv("../results/3-elderlypatients.csv")
knitr::kable(elderlypatients)
```


The age distribution of each condition per cohort was also examined.

In @fig-agedistribution, the dotted vertical lines are the mean of the age at death for each condition.
