### Preview of Data
The data used is from the [@388Brains] set of cohorts, with its samples. The raw data of the annotated expression matrices can be found [here](https://brainscope.gersteinlab.org/output-sample-annotated-matrix.html). This is an overview of each cohort:
- CMC: 
- DevBrain:
- Girgenti-multiome:
- IsoHuB:
- LIBD:
- Ma_et_al: [@MaSestan]
- MultiomeBrain:
- PTSDBrainomics: 
- SZBDMulti-Seq:
- UCLA-ASD:
- Velmeshev_et_al: [@Velmeshev]

- total number of patients per cohort
- number of patients/individuals per condition per cohort
- total number of single cells per cohort
- distribution of age per condition per cohort
- summary of brain region studied in each cohort
- what clinical condition is being studied per cohort
- number of genes per cohort
