## Summary

TBF

## Introduction

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a mental disorder that affects 0.3-0.7%. It has many symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations. Although many studies have come out studying the transcriptome of patients with this disorder, a clearer picture is needed. This project aims to uncover the transcriptome of Schizophrenia patients, which cell types are associated with this disorder, and review past methods from other papers.

## Methods

The following sub-segments cover the methods employed, as well as the results obtained.

### Preview of the Data

The data used is from the @388Brains set of cohorts, with its samples. The raw data of the annotated expression matrices can be found [here](https://brainscope.gersteinlab.org/output-sample-annotated-matrix.html). The raw metadata can be found [here](https://brainscope.gersteinlab.org/integrative_files.html) under the name of PEC2_sample_mapping.xlsx.

An additional cohort, named Batiuk, was included in the study as well [@batiuk]. Its matrices and cell-type annotations can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/6921620). Its metadata can be found as a supplementary file in its paper.

All the samples come from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These are all the cohorts:

1.  CMC [@Ruzicka, @cmc2]
2.  DevBrain
3.  Girgenti-multiome
4.  IsoHuB
5.  LIBD [@huuki, @yap]
6.  Ma_et_al [@MaSestan]
7.  MultiomeBrain
8.  PTSDBrainomics [@ptsdbrainomics]
9.  SZBDMulti-Seq [@Ruzicka]
10. ROSMAP
11. UCLA-ASD [@ucla-asd1, @ucla-asd2]
12. Velmeshev_et_al [@Velmeshev]
13. Batiuk [@batiuk]

However, because no annotated matrices were provided for the ROSMAP cohort, these were filtered out from the metadata.

This is an overview of each cohort:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-total-patients
#| tbl-cap: Each cohort with the total patients studied, the mean of the age of death, and disease studied.

total_patients <- readRDS("../results/1-total_patients.rds")
knitr::kable(total_patients)
```

From @tbl-total-patients, we can see that the CMC cohort has the biggest number of patient samples with 100 samples, followed by SZBDMulti-seq with 72. Ma_et_al has the smallest size, with only 2 samples. CMC has the highest mean in age, at 71 years old. SZBDMulti-Seq and Batiuk share the same mean age, at 65 years old. Velmeshev_et_al has the lowest one, at 18 years. A variety of diseases are studied in these cohorts, with some cohorts studying none. These diseases include schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and Williams Syndrome.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-patientpercondition
#| tbl-cap: Number of patients per condition per cohort. Includes the mean age and the biological sex as well.

patientpercondition <- readRDS("../results/2-patients_per_condition.rds")
knitr::kable(patientpercondition)
```

@tbl-patientpercondition indicates the number of patients per condition in each cohort. The CMC cohort has the highest numbers, with 53 control samples and 47 schizophrenia samples. The UCLA-ASD is second, with 27 ASD samples and 25 control samples. The mean of age at death and the distribution of the biological sexes is also shown in this table.

It must be noted that many patients' age at death was marked as "89+". In order to determine the age distribution and the mean age of death, these values were converted to "89". The number of samples that were marked as "89+" from the Schizophrenia cohorts is in @tbl-elderlypatients.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-elderlypatients
#| tbl-cap: Number of patients annotated as "89+" in Schizophrenia cohorts.

elderlypatients <- readRDS("../results/3-elderlypatients.rds")
knitr::kable(elderlypatients)
```

The age at death distribution of each condition per cohort was also examined. In @fig-agedistribution, the dotted vertical lines are the mean of the age at death for each condition. From top to bottom and left to right:

-   CMC: both conditions fall in the older range.
-   DevBrain: control samples fall between the 25-50 range. ASD samples faill in the younger range, with an average of around 25 years. Williams Syndrome samples are also in the younger range, although their average is slightly higher than 25.
-   Girgenti-snMultiome: there are only control samples. The average is around 50 years old.
-   Batiuk: the age distribution of both groups appear similar, within the 50-75 age range. The average of the Schizophrenia group is slightly older.
-   IsoHub: there are only control samples and most fall in the younger range.
-   LIBD: there are only control samples and most of them fall in the 50 year range.
-   SZBDMulti-Seq: both control and Schizophrenia samples have similar distributions ad averages of around 60 years. THe BPD samples' distribution is shifted slightly more towards the right, with an older average of around 60 years old.
-   Ma-Sestan: there are only control samples. There is one sample that falls around 50 years old, and the other that falls around 60 years old.
-   PTSDBrainomics: control and MDD samples fall in the 50 year range. PTSD samples are slightly younger in average, but their distribution is wide.
-   MultiomeBrain: although most control samples fall between the 30-45 range, there are samples that are younger than 25 and older than 50. Schizophrenia samples fall around the 50 year age range, and BPD samples fall between the 30-45 range.
-   UCLA-ASD: both control and ASD samples fall in the younger range, with an average of around 25 years.
-   Velmeshev_et_al: most ASD and control samples are under 25 years old.

### Examining the Schizophrenia Cohorts

As the main interest of this project is Schizophrenia, only cohorts related to Schizophrenia were used in subsequent analysis.

The number of patients, split by disorder and colored by sex, can be seen in @fig-patientbarplot.

![Bar plot of number of patients per cohort, split into disorder and colored by sex.](../results/12-patientbarplot.png){#fig-patientbarplot}

The distribution of ages was looked at in @fig-age_dist_plots.

-   Top left: histogram of the ages of all patients corresponding to the Schizophrenia cohorts. Most individuals are between the ages of 60 and 90, and a peak is observed at 89 years.
-   Top right: quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of the ages from Schizophrenia patients compared to those of the control. Since most points fall along the reference line, the age distributions between the two groups are quite similar. The deviation seen at the ends of the line suggests differences in the distribution tails, most likely by the presence of older individuals in the control group than in the diseased group.
-   Middle left: histogram of the ages of all patients corresponding to the Schizophrenia cohorts, colored by disease. The Schizophrenia group has a lower median. We can also see that there are more older individuals from the control group.
-   Middle right: violin plot of the age distributions for the control and Schizophrenia groups. The shape and spread shows that the density and distribution of both groups are quite similar.
-   Bottom left: histogram of the ages of all patients corresponding to the Schizophrenia cohorts, colored by sex. The male group has a lower median. We can also see that there are more older individuals from the female group.
-   Bottom right: violin plot of the age distributions for the female and male groups. The female group exhibits a slightly broader age range than the male group.

The distribution of number of cells per patient was looked at in @fig-cellcount_dist_plots.

-   Top left: violin plot of the cell count distribution compared by condition. In the Batiuk cohort, it appears that control samples have higher cell counts. The CMC cohort's schizophrenia cell counts appear to be generally lower than the control group, with the control group having a broader range. The MultiomeBrain cohort has a narrow distribution in both groups, with the Schizophrenia group having a higher median and slightly wider spread. In the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort, the schizophrenia group has a broader distribution.
-   Top right: QQ-plot of the cell counts between control and Schizophrenia groups. It indicates that there are similar distributions at lower cell counts, but deviations at higher quantiles suggest that one condition often has larger cell counts per patient.
-   Bottom left: violin plot of the cell count distribution compared by sex. The Batiuk cohort's female group appears to have higher cell counts. In the CMC cohort, the shape and spread of both groups appears to be quite similar. In the MultiomeBrain cohort, the female cohort has a higher median and broader spread than the male group. In the SZBDMulti-Seq group, the male group has a broader distribution.
-   Bottom right: QQ-plot of the cell counts between female and male groups. There are similar distributions at lower cell counts, but deviations in higher quantiles suggest that one group often has higher cell counts in the upper range.

### Filtering

The number of genes and single cells per each Schizophrenia cohort was also looked at in @tbl-genescells. The number of genes is per sample, whereas the number of cells is the total number for all samples in a cohort.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-genescells
#| tbl-cap: Number of genes and total number of cells per each Schizophrenia cohort.

cells_genes <- readRDS("../results/5-cells_genes.rds")
knitr::kable(cells_genes)
```

The number of genes is quite similar across the four cohorts. SZBDMulti-Seq has the highest number of total cells, at 603281. MultiomeBrain has the lowest number of total cells, at 134666.

From @Ruzicka (worked with the CMC and SZBDMulti-Seq cohorts), genes expressed in less than 0.1% cells and cells with fewer than 1000 identified genes were removed. If they had more than 10% unique molecular identifiers in mitochondrial genes or more than 50000 captured UMIs, these were also removed. They also determined outlier cells by checking their total UMI count, percentage of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes, low similarity with other cells, and exploration of 2D projection plots. These were also removed.

From @batiuk (worked with the Batiuk cohort), scrublet scores were determined for each dataset, and only cells with the score below 0.3 were considered for downstream analysis. Subtype-sample combinations with less than 10 cells were filtered out.

For our purposes, each matrix was first wrangled into six major cell types:

-   Excitatory neurons: these include neurons that are L2/3 intratelencephalic, L4 IT intratelencephalic, L5 intratelencephalic, L6 intratelencephalic, L6 corticothalamic, L6 intratelencephalic Car3, L5 extratelencephalic, LE/6 near-projecting, and L6b intratelencephalic.
-   Inhibitory neurons: these chandelier cells and neurons that express somatostatin, somatostatin and chondrolectin, parvalbumin, paired box 6, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 5 and LIM homeobox protein 6, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 5, synuclein gamma, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide.
-   Astrocytes
-   Microglia cells
-   OLigodendrocyte progenitor cells
-   Oligodendrocytes

Within each cell type, genes that are not expressed in at least 2% of cells were filtered out. Cells that were in the top 5th percentile in terms of the number of expressed genes were kept. After that, genes that were expressed in at least 3 out of the 4 cohorts within a cell type were kept. The artifacts shown hereafter have been generated using filtered data.

In @tbl-genescellsfiltered, we can see the number of genes that appear in all 4 cohorts for each cell type. Astrocytes have the highest number at 27011, and inhibitory neurons have the lowest number at 18533. The second column shows the total number of unique genes for each cell type across cohorts. Excitatory neurons have the highest number at 41487, while glial cells have the lowest number at 21223.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-genescellsfiltered
#| tbl-cap: Number of genes that overlap and are unique for each cell type.

cells_genes_filtered <- readRDS("../results/5.2-overlapped_genes.rds")
knitr::kable(cells_genes_filtered)
```

@tbl-ngenescells shows the number of genes and cells that were in each cell type and cohort. Note that the number of genes is the same for each cell type due to the previous filtering. Microglia have the lowest number of genes at 6838 and excitatory neurons have the highest number at 14010. Microglia from the MultiomeBrain have the lowest number of cells at 2750 and excitatory neurons from the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort have the largest number at 233710. The total number of cells is 1076886.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-ngenescells
#| tbl-cap: Number of genes and cells found in each cohort and cell type.

cells_genes_filtered <- readRDS("../results/5.3-n_genes_cells.rds")
knitr::kable(cells_genes_filtered)
```

### Quality checks

The next thing that was looked into was the number of cells per cell-type per patient. In @fig-celltypedistribution, we can see that excitatory neurons have the highest frequency, especially by the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort. This is followed by oligodendrocytes. Microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells have the lowest frequencies.

The sequencing depth of each cell was investigated, grouped by cell type. @fig-1depthdistribution shows the sequencing depth distribution with all the x-axis at the same scale. @fig-2depthdistribution shows the sequencing depth distribution with all the x-axis unscaled. @fig-3depthdistribution shows the sequencing depth distribution after the matrices had been CPMLog normalized, with all the x-axis at the same scale. @fig-4depthdistribution shows the sequencing depth distrbution after CPMLog normalization, but with the x-axis unscaled. Across all three cohorts, excitatory neurons have the highest sequencing depth, especially in the MultiomeBrain cohort. Microglia have the lowest sequencing depth in all cohorts.

The difference in cell type abundance per condition was investigated in each cohort in @fig-abundancecelltype. It appears that control samples have a slightly higher number of cells than disease samples. In CMC's microglia, MultiomeBrain's astrocytes and oligodendroctes, SZBDMulti-Seq's astrocytes and microglia, the disease samples have a slighly higher number of cells. In accordance with what has been seen so far, excitatory neurons have the highest frequency while microglia have the lowest.

UMAP was performed for each cohort, colored according to different characteristics. In @fig-celltypeumap, we can see that the cell types were assigned to different clusters. @fig-disorderumap shows the UMAP assignment by disorder and @fig-sexumap by biological sex. It appears that both conditions/characteristics are evenly spread across cells. @fig-patientumap shows the clusters colored by patient. It appears it is evenly spread as well. The cell type assignment for the MultiomeBrain cohort does appear to be slightly different, most likely due to the fact it is the smallest cohort. It does appear that there is one patient that might be affecting the clusters in the MultiomeBrain cohort.

### Differential expression analysis

To perform DEA, matrices were pseudobulked. Different methods and approaches were used.

#### Counts per million (edgeR)

A counts per million normalization was applied. The DEA method use was from the edgeR package. No covariates were added.

@fig-cmclogfccpm, @fig-batiuklogfccpm, @fig-mblogfccpm, and @fig-szbdlogfccpm show the histograms of the log fold-changes for each cohort. These follow a normal distribution, centered at 0.

![Log fold-change histograms of the CMC cohort after CPM normalization.](../results/DEA/CMC/CPM/logFCplot_CMC.png){#fig-cmclogfccpm}

![Log fold-change histograms of the Batiuk cohort after CPM normalization.](../results/DEA/Batiuk/CPM/logFCplot_Batiuk.png){#fig-batiuklogfccpm}

![Log fold-change histograms of the MultiomeBrain cohort after CPM normalization.](../results/DEA/MultiomeBrain/CPM/logFCplot_MultiomeBrain.png){#fig-mblogfccpm}

![Log fold-change histograms of the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort after CPM normalization.](../results/DEA/SZBDMulti-Seq/CPM/logFCplot_SZBDMulti-Seq.png){#fig-szbdlogfccpm}

@fig-cmcpvalcpm, @fig-batiukpvalcpm, @fig-mbpvalcpm, and @fig-szbdpvalcpm show the histograms of the raw p-values for each cohort. It appears that for all cohorts, there is no differential expression. The SZBDMulti-Seq cohort is the only that might have differential expression. 

![P-value histograms of the CMC cohort after CPM normalization.](../results/DEA/CMC/CPM/pvalueplot_CMC.png){#fig-cmcpvalcpm}

![P-value histograms of the Batiuk cohort after CPM normalization.](../results/DEA/Batiuk/CPM/pvalueplot_Batiuk.png){#fig-batiukpvalcpm}

![P-value histograms of the MultiomeBrain cohort after CPM normalization.](../results/DEA/MultiomeBrain/CPM/pvalueplot_MultiomeBrain.png){#fig-mbpvalcpm}

![P-value histograms of the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort after CPM normalization.](../results/DEA/SZBDMulti-Seq/CPM/pvalueplot_SZBDMulti-Seq.png){#fig-szbdpvalcpm}

@fig-cmcvolcpm, @fig-batiukvolcpm, @fig-mbvolcpm, and @fig-szbdvolcpm show the volcano plots of each cohort. A FDR cutoff of 0.05 and a logFC cutoff of 0.5 was used. Only the 4 following groups had differentially expressed genes, although few: inhibitory neurons of the CMC cohort, astroctyes of the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort, microglia of the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort, and oligodendrocytes of the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort.

Overall, the lack of differential expression seen made us stay away from this method.

#### Counts per million and log (edgeR)

A counts per million normalization was applied, along with a log transformation. The DEA method use was from the edgeR package. No covariates were added.

@fig-cmclogfcCPMLog, @fig-batiuklogfcCPMLog, @fig-mblogfcCPMLog, and @fig-szbdlogfcCPMLog show the histograms of the log fold-changes for each cohort. These follow a normal distribution, centered at 0.

![Log fold-change histograms of the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort after CPMLog normalization.](../results/DEA/SZBDMulti-Seq/CPMLog/logFCplot_SZBDMulti-Seq.png){#fig-szbdlogfcCPMLog}

@fig-cmcpvalCPMLog, @fig-batiukpvalCPMLog, @fig-mbpvalCPMLog, and @fig-szbdpvalCPMLog show the histograms of the raw p-values for each cohort. It appears that for all cohorts, there is no differential expression. Compared to the CPM only method, it appears that the log transformation is skewing the histgrams to the right.

#### Counts per million and log with age and sex (edgeR)

A counts per million normalization was applied, followed by a log transformation. The DEA method use was from the edgeR package. Apart from the disorder group, age and sex were added as covariates.

@fig-cmclogfcCPMLogWithCovariates, @fig-batiuklogfcCPMLogWithCovariates, @fig-mblogfcCPMLogWithCovariates, and @fig-szbdlogfcCPMLogWithCovariates show the histograms of the log fold-changes for each cohort. These follow a normal distribution, centered at 0.

@fig-cmcvolTMM, @fig-batiukvolTMM, @fig-mbvolTMM, and @fig-szbdvolTMM show the volcano plots of each cohort. A FDR cutoff of 0.05 and a logFC cutoff of 0.5 was used. Most groups had only 1-3 genes that were differentially expressed. The SZBDMulti-Seq's excitatory neurons was the only group to have a substantial number of DGEs.

Overall, the lack of differential expression seen made us stay away from this method.

### DEA on Batiuk subtypes

As there was a lack of DEGs detected (with the SZBDMulti-Seq cohort as an exception), the results from the @batiuk paper were replicated. As they performed DEA on neuronal subtypes, the same was done. Note that genes that were not expressed at all were removed.

The first DEA method performed on the neuronal subtypes was a CPM normalization, followed by a log transformation. DEA was performed with the limma package. @fig-batiukexclogfc shows the log fold change histograms of the excitatory neuronal subtypes, all following a normal distribution and centered at 0. @fig-batiukexcpval shows the p-value histograms of the excitatory neuronal subtypes, although it does not appear to have much differential expression. And confirmed in @fig-batiukexcvol, no DEGs are detected. A logFC cutoff of 0.1 and a FDR cutoff of 0.05 were set.

![Volcano plots of the Batiuk's excitatory subtypes, after CPMLog normalization.](../results/DEA/Batiuk/LimmaCPMLog/excitatoryvolcanoplot_Batiuk.png){#fig-batiukexcvol}

The same trend is seen in the inhibitory subtypes. @fig-batiukinhlogfc shows the log fold change histograms of the inhibitory neuronal subtypes, all following a normal distribution and centered at 0. @fig-batiukinhpval shows the p-value histograms of the inhibitory neuronal subtypes. In @fig-batiukinhvol, no DEGs are detected. A logFC cutoff of 0.1 and a FDR cutoff of 0.05 were set.

![Volcano plots of the Batiuk's inhibitory subtypes, after CPMLog normalization.](../results/DEA/Batiuk/LimmaCPMLog/inhibitoryvolcanoplot_Batiuk.png){#fig-batiukinhvol}

The next DEA method was the same, with just the addition of age and sex as covariates. @fig-batiukexclogfcas shows the log fold change histograms of the excitatory neuronal subtypes, all following a normal distribution and centered at 0. @fig-batiukexcpvalas shows the p-value histograms of the excitatory neuronal subtypes. It appears that all subtypes have differential expression, with the exception of the L5_FEZF2_ADRA1A subtype. In @fig-batiukexcvolas, many DEGs were seen in all subtypes. A logFC cutoff of 0.1 and a FDR cutoff of 0.05 were set.

However, when compared to the paper, it appears that none of these DEGs were found in @batiuk. Note that the authors did not provide a table with all DEGs and as such, the DEGs they discovered was based on the volcano plots they provided in the supplemenary files. This could have led to some genes being missed in the comparison of the results.

### CMC & SZBDMulti-Seq MetaAnalysis

To replicate the @Ruzicka results, a meta-analysis was performed. The DEA method used was CPMLog normalization with age and sex as covariates, with the limma package.

@fig-logfcmetaruzi shows the logFC histograms of the metaanalysis, where they all follow a normal distribution and are centered at 0. @fig-pvalmetaruzi shows the p-value histograms of the metaanalysis, where it appears that all cell types have differential expression. This is confirmed in @fig-volmetaruzi, where we see a high number of DEGs in each cell type. A logFC cutoff of 0.1 and an FDR cutoff of 0.05 were set.
